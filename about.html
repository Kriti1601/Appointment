            of ethical practise.<br> <br>
          
            Though the building at lanka remains much the same, the medical technology being used to provide services has been continously upgraded. We take pride in 
            offering the services of the only NABL Accredited Lab in this part of the country(i.e. Heritage Speciality Labs), the most updated Radiology department;

            for correct diagnosis and the right treatment coupled with the strength of an experienced nursing and paramedical term, makes Heritage a preferred choice for
            all discerning patients. This also makes us a preferred hospital for a large number of corporate bodies such as Navaratna's and Maharatna's such as Indian Oil
